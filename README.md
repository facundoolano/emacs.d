My emacs configuration. Previously based on prelude.

``` shell
brew install emacs --with-cocoa --with-gnutls --with-dbus --with-librsvg --with-imagemagick@6 --with-mailutils --devel
npm install -g livedown
npm install -g mocha
npm install -g eslint
brew install candid82/brew/joker
```

run from spotlight:

- open /usr/local/Cellar/emacs/26.0.91/
- make alias
- drag to dock
