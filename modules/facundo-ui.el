;;; facundo-ui.el --- Emacs Prelude: UI optimizations and tweaks.

;;; Commentary:

;; We dispense with most of the point and click UI, reduce the startup noise,
;; configure smooth scolling and a nice theme that's easy on the eyes (zenburn).

;;; Code:

;; the toolbar is just a waste of valuable screen estate
;; in a tty tool-bar-mode does not properly auto-load, and is
;; already disabled anyway
(when (fboundp 'tool-bar-mode)
  (tool-bar-mode -1))

(menu-bar-mode -1)

;; the blinking cursor is nothing, but an annoyance
(blink-cursor-mode -1)

;; disable the annoying bell ring
(setq ring-bell-function 'ignore)

;; disable startup screen
(setq inhibit-startup-screen t)

;; nice scrolling
(setq scroll-margin 0
      scroll-conservatively 100000
      scroll-preserve-screen-position 1)

;; mode line settings
(line-number-mode t)
(column-number-mode t)
(size-indication-mode t)

;; enable y/n answers
(fset 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)

;; more useful frame title, that show either a file or a
;; buffer name (if the buffer isn't visiting a file)
;; (setq frame-title-format
;;       '("" invocation-name " Prelude - " (:eval (if (buffer-file-name)
;;                                             (abbreviate-file-name (buffer-file-name))
;;                                           "%b"))))

;; show the cursor when moving after big movements in the window
(require 'beacon)
(beacon-mode +1)

;; show available keybindings after you start typing
(require 'which-key)
(which-key-mode +1)

(provide 'facundo-ui)
;;; prelude-ui.el ends here
